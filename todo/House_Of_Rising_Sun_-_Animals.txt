There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E   E
They call the Risin' Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.

And God, I know I'm one.

Now, the only thing a gambler needs
     Am       C     E     E
Is a suitcase and a trunk

And the only time that he's satis-fied
   Am        E    Am
Is when he's on a drunk
