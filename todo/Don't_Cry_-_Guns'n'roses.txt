Verse 2. (chords same as above)

Give me a whisper. And give me a sigh. 
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye.

I'll still be thinkin' of you. And the times we had...baby.

Chorus

Verse 3.

And please remember that I never lied. 
And please remember how I felt inside now honey. 
You gotta make it your own way. But you'll be alright now sugar. 
You'll feel better tomorrow. Come the morning light now baby.

Chorus
